# Software-Engineering-Project
This project was quite interesting to do because the designing part of the online system for McGreoger Institute of Botanical Training was done. The project designing part included Use case diagrams, Communication diagrams and Sequence diagrams. Agile Scrum methodology was followed for the development of the project.
